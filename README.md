# ICVI-SRS-Cone-Collision-Check
Varian Eclipse ESAPI script to check for collisions with SRS Cone and support structure (VisionRT head adjuster)

Checks distance from structures named VRT, BODY, and CouchSurface, to bottom of cone (minus a 1cm safety margin) for all couch and gantry angles.  Does not account for diameter of cone.  

Used clinically as a planning aid.  All arcs are checked on the linac prior to treatment during a dry run.
