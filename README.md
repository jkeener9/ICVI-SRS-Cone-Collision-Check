# ICVI-SRS-Cone-Collision-Check
Varian Eclipse ESAPI script to check for collisions with SRS Cone and support structure (VisionRT head adjuster)

Checks distance from isocenter to bottom of cone, minus a 1cm safety margin.  Does not account for diameter of cone.  

Used clinically as a planning aid.  All arcs are checked on the linac prior to treatment during a dry run.
